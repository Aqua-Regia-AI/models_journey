# Maral : Mann-E's way to LLMs

Image generation space is cool. There is a lot of cultural potential in image generation space and there is no doubt of that but when we look deep in how people kept their languages alive, there are multiple phases which make you scratch your head for a moment. 

I am not really a linguistics expert but I read enough about my own language. The phases of saving Persian language from multiple big replacements are really cool and I think it is a really good lesson on how a nation can save their national treasures. But what were these steps? 

## How my ancestors saved Persian lanugage

First when Persian speaking kings or warriors could find a chance to take over the Iranian land (I mean mostly the modern day Iran and not the ancient Persia) before Arabic speaking caliphates or after their collapses, they immediately made Persian their national language and people followed them as well. This was a good step but not enough. Then scholars started collecting the epics and stories of pre-Islamic era and one of the most famous ones is _Epic of The Kings_ or _Shahnameh_ by _Ferdowsi_. 

Ferdowsi is the person known for saving Persian language although this is not a hundred percent true. He tried and he was successful but people after him continued this movement. For centuries, poetry was a way of keeping this beautiful language alive but when Qajar dynasty took over Iran, the space changed a lot. Our people were introduced to newspapers and magazines and novels (mostly because of the connections of Qajars with France and UK.) and this was the new way of saving the language. 

Years passed and we introduced to the internet. Internet content creation was really a thing and it also helped a lot. People wrote blogs, made channels on YouTube, made forums and group chats and this was a new phase. But the most important phase of saving a language is still remained. This is _Artificial Intelligence_.
