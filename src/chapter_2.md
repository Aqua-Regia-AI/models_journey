# The story of Mann-E

This part of the book is dedicated to the mother company of _Aqua Regia_ which is called [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com). The story and start point of the whole new business has been started from here so it was worth having a whole chapter dedicated. 

Also, in order to give up some information on my culture, Iranian men are famous for talking a lot about their good memories. You can count this chapter as one of the most Iranian parts of this whole document. Anyway, let's get started!

## A friend on Twitter

_Finding like minded individuals_ is the only thing I am good at. On most of the social media platforms and specially twitter (don't really care if it's called X now) I always have a good base of like minded individuals who are really good at their jobs. 

This superpower helped me a lot. And it is the beginning of my serious entrepreneurship journey! You may ask how? Simple. One day I saw one of my friends posts weird abstract paintings on his page. And later, he said that he made those using _artificial intelligence_ and it made me more curious and excited about the whole topic. I DMed him and asked about the procedure and he was nice and generous enough to give me links to tools he was using. 

After that, I had the most important thing. __The keywords__. I did my own research as well and I found OpenAI's `CLIP` which is still used in order to describe the images in a lot of tools (like Automatic1111 WebUI or ComfyUI.). But I was in search of a generative tool which puts me in absolute control. Then I found something called `VQGAN+CLIP` which was like magic. I just wrote a few lines of description and it was like it is giving me my internal weirdness in form of an abstract painting!

I have started posting these artworks on Twitter and some of my friends got curious about that. It becomes some sort of tradition for our gatherings. I was like a magician or a showman who can turn people's dreams into a painting in the blink of an eye. This was the start of the business!

## First phase of monetization

It was summer of 2022 and one of my friends - who is a marketer - joined me to monetize the project. We decided to make it like this: "People give us their prompts, we generate for them, print it on wooden frames and send it to them". It was a good business model at first glance but had a lot of flaws. First, when we didn't have any GPU's and we relied on _free tier google colab_ for generation of the images, we couldn't give our customers mulitple options to choose from. 

And by now you probably are generating a dozen images or logos before choosing one for your purpose right? Imagine how worse it could be three years ago. The next flaw was the logistics. We had to get wooden frames and store them. We had to talk to print houses and we had to find the efficient way to handle the orders and sending them to customers efficiently. 

So this was failed. But there was another thing happening at the same time!
