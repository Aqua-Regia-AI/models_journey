# Jabir Project

As I said in the previous chapter, this was the name of an old project of mine which wasn't in AI space at all. Jabir Project was my first big move towards being a tech entrepreneur and it initially was a project with the goal of making an operating system. 

First releases of Jabir were basically remastered versions of Ubuntu, then I found out hacking together a FreeBSD based system is more fun (conclusion? It was a fun project from a teenager's brain) and started working on it. 

The third phase is actually the AI phase and in this short chapter I explain what it is. It is basically a finetune of LLaMA 3.1 405B on Persian data and is available through a free API at its [website](https://jabirproject.org). 

But the success of Jabir, made me think about a more organized project, which will be covered in next chapter of this document. The next chapter will be the final one and you will find out why having _a family of models_ is a better option to do everything on top of a single model.
