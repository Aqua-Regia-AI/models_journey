# Introduction

The warmest greetings from _Aqua Regia_ organization (a division of [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com)) to you, our dear reader and user. The present book, is our journey to develop this new model which is currently based on `DeepSeek-V3 0324` and it will be updated (or even changed) in possible future. In this book we cover why we made this journey and why you have access to multiple models in one family of models. You'll be getting more familiar with our company, why it has started and why open source AI matters more than any time nowadays. 

We hope you gather useful information and insights after studying our journey to the model development. We try the best to keep the book as short as possible, just telling the story of our journey to this point and nothing more.

## About the project's founder

I am [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) (Also available on [X (Formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/haghiri_ai)). The founder and current CEO of Mann-E, which is a generative AI platform based on fine-tuned models we're building. I was born May 30th 1996 in Tehran, Iran and started coding at the age of 12. 

In years of experiencing coding and developing software, I have been in different exciting areas of the whole business of software development. At first, I just started turning everything I learned in math and physics into Windows applications using VB6 (and later Visual Basic .NET). When I got a little more familiar with the software market, I started learning C# as well. But when I was 15, everything has changed. I just discovered a whole new world and it was _The Fascinating World of Free Software_. 

I just remember the day I installed Linux. This change, made me have more ambitious goals in mind. Such as making a whole new operating system. Even those years, I spend an awful lot of time on developing a Linux distirbution. It was a failure, but it also was the start of a whole new journey for me. The journey of being an entrepreneur. 

In 2023, I founded Mann-E (which will have its own chapter) and it was and is the most successful business I've ever owned. But later in 2024, I noticed something which was not good at all. Most of _Local Language Models_ couldn't understand my language which is _Persian_. Therefore it made new sparks in my head. 

All the above stories will be covered in the following chapters, so you can patiently study my amazing journey to be an entrepreneur and the reasons why _Aqua Regia_ is a non profit organization. 

## Why this is not a technical document?

This document is only about the journey. There are quite a few parts where you can find technical documentations or technical language, but most the content will be just a story of a journey and why those decisions were made. 

Honestly most of the AI companies give up very good technical information (even closed source ones) but no one talks about the behind the scenes. If we want to frame a good picture of the current AI scene, there are some windmills you think are dangerous giants but they're just hyped up local competition. The actuall giants are under the ground. After you pass the windmills, you will find a big lake full of black swans and the lake is surrounded by landmines. 

The point here is not to scare you about starting an AI business. The point is to help you build your business with eyes wide open and a good understanding of the surroundings. 

## Who's the audience of this document?

This book is not only for developers. But for everyone who wants to know what is happening behind the scenes of an AI business. Everyone who wants to know why non-profit and open organizations matter. Everyone who wants to change the world!
